    ///   - longPressDelay: The time it takes for a press to count as a long press.
    ///   - longPressAction: The action to trigger when the button is long pressed, by default `nil`.
    ///   - doubleTapTimeout: The max time between two taps for them to count as a double tap.
    ///   - doubleTapAction: The action to trigger when the button is double tapped, by default `nil`.
    ///   - repeatDelay: The time it takes for a press to count as a repeat trigger.
    ///   - repeatTimer: The repeat timer to use for the repeat action.
    ///   - repeatAction: The action to repeat while the button is being pressed, by default `nil`.
    ///   - dragStartAction: The action to trigger when a drag gesture starts.
    ///   - dragAction: The action to trigger when a drag gesture changes.
